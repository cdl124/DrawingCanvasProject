# Shapesnstuff

A colorful, simple canvas app. Draw your masterpiece, click "Save", and then click the Gallery icon to find your masterpiece added with others' artwork.

This canvas app was a JavaScript 301 final project, put together by students Jacob Knaack ([GitHub](http://www.github.com/JacobKnaack "Jacob Knaack GitHub")) and myself, Cortney Drummond. The app is currently much in the same state that it was on presentation day, but updates are planned to change the layout, user experience, and the gallery display.

Jacob worked on:
* The canvas element and all its shapes, lines, and colors, using CreateJS
* All the buttons and icons, some created from scratch!

Cortney worked on:
* The name, color theme, and CSS layout of the app
* The back-end work that saves the artwork to an AWS S3 bucket, and then fetches all artwork saved to that bucket and displays them upon pressing the Gallery button.

And yes, it is pronounced "Shapes n' Stuff". Enjoy!
